.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libinput 
is an __xservername__ input driver based on libinput.  It
therefore supports all input devices that libinput can handle, including
most mice, keyboards, tablets and touchscreens.
.PP
It is recommended that
.B libinput
devices are configured through the
.B InputClass
directive (refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__)) instead of manual
per-device configuration. Devices configured in the
__xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) are not hot-plug capable.

.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
.PP
The following driver 
.B Options
are supported:
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDevice\*q \*q" string \*q
Specifies the device through which the device can be accessed.  This will 
generally be of the form \*q/dev/input/eventX\*q, where X is some integer.
The mapping from device node to hardware is system-dependent. Property:
"Device Node" (read-only).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelSpeed\*q \*q" float \*q
Sets the pointer acceleration speed within the range [-1, 1]
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qButtonMapping\*q \*q" string \*q
Sets the logical button mapping for this device, see
XSetPointerMapping(__libmansuffix__). The string must be a
space-separated list of button mappings in the order of the
logical buttons on the device, starting with button 1.
The default mapping is "1 2 3 ... 32". A mapping of 0
deactivates the button. Multiple buttons can have the same mapping.
Invalid mapping strings are discarded and the default mapping
is used for all buttons. Buttons not specified in the user's mapping use the
default mapping. See section
.B BUTTON MAPPING
for more details.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qCalibrationMatrix\*q \*q" string \*q
A string of 9 space-separated floating point numbers.
Sets the calibration matrix to the 3x3 matrix where the first row is (abc),
the second row is (def) and the third row is (ghi).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qClickMethod\*q \*q" string \*q
Enables a click method. Permitted values are
.BI none,
.BI buttonareas,
.BI clickfinger.
Not all devices support all methods, if an option is unsupported, the
default click method for this device is used.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qLeftHanded\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables left-handed button orientation, i.e. swapping left and right buttons.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qMiddleEmulation\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables middle button emulation. When enabled, pressing the left and right
buttons simultaneously produces a middle mouse button click.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qNaturalScrolling\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables natural scrolling behavior.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qScrollButton\*q \*q" int \*q
Designates a button as scroll button. If the
.BI ScrollMethod
is
.BI button
and the button is logically held down, x/y axis movement is converted into
scroll events.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qScrollMethod\*q \*q" string \*q
Enables a scroll method. Permitted values are
.BI none,
.BI twofinger,
.BI edge,
.BI button.
Not all devices support all options, if an option is unsupported, the
default scroll option for this device is used.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qSendEventsMode\*q \*q" (disabled|enabled|disabled-on-external-mouse) \*q
Sets the send events mode to disabled, enabled, or "disable when an external
mouse is connected".
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTapping\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables tap-to-click behavior.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTappingDragLock\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables drag lock during tapping behavior. When enabled, a
finger up during tap-and-drag will not immediately release the button. If
the finger is set down again within the timeout, the draging process
continues.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qHalfkey\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables halfkey mirrored keyboard accessibility support.
This allows a modifier key (by default the space bar) to act as a method
for reflecting the keyboard down the 5tgb/6yhn line for one-handed touch typing.
.PP
For all options, the options are only parsed if the device supports that
configuration option. For all options, the default value is the one used by
libinput. On configuration failure, the default value is applied.

.SH SUPPORTED PROPERTIES
.B libinput
exports runtime-configurable options as properties. If a property listed
below is not available, the matching configuration option is not available
on the device. This however does not imply that the feature is not available
on the device. The following properties are provided by the
.B libinput
driver.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Tapping Enabled"
1 boolean value (8 bit, 0 or 1). 1 enables tapping
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Tapping Drag Lock Enabled"
1 boolean value (8 bit, 0 or 1). 1 enables drag lock during tapping
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Calibration Matrix"
9 32-bit float values, representing a 3x3 calibration matrix, order is row
1, row 2, row 3
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Accel Speed"
1 32-bit float value, defines the pointer speed. Value range -1, 1
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled"
1 boolean value (8 bit, 0 or 1). 1 enables natural scrolling
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Send Events Modes Available"
2 boolean values (8 bit, 0 or 1), in order "disabled" and
"disabled-on-external-mouse". Indicates which send-event modes are available
on this device.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Send Events Mode Enabled"
2 boolean values (8 bit, 0 or 1), in order "disabled" and
"disabled-on-external-mouse". Indicates which send-event modes is currently
enabled on this device.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Left Handed Enabled"
1 boolean value (8 bit, 0 or 1). Indicates if left-handed mode is enabled or
disabled.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Scroll Methods Available"
3 boolean values (8 bit, 0 or 1), in order "two-finger", "edge", "button".
Indicates which scroll methods are available on this device.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Scroll Method Enabled"
3 boolean values (8 bit, 0 or 1), in order "two-finger", "edge", "button".
Indicates which scroll method is currently enabled on this device.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Button Scrolling Button"
1 32-bit value. Sets the button number to use for button scrolling. This
setting is independent of the scroll method, to enable button scrolling the
method must be set to button-scrolling and a valid button must be set.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Click Methods Available"
2 boolean values (8 bit, 0 or 1), in order "buttonareas", "clickfinger".
Indicates which click methods are available on this device.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Click Methods Enabled"
2 boolean values (8 bit, 0 or 1), in order "buttonareas", "clickfinger".
Indicates which click methods are enabled on this device.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Middle Emulation Enabled"
1 boolean value (8 bit, 0 or 1). Indicates if middle emulation is enabled or
disabled.
.TP 7
.BI "libinput Halfkey Accessibility Enabled"
1 boolean value (8 bit, 0 or 1). Indicates if halfkey accessibility support is
enabled or disabled.
.TP7
.PP
The above properties have a
.BI "libinput <property name> Default"
equivalent that indicates the default value for this setting on this device.

.SH BUTTON MAPPING
X clients receive events with logical button numbers, where 1, 2, 3
are usually interpreted as left, middle, right and logical buttons 4, 5, 6,
7 are usually interpreted as scroll up, down, left, right. The fourth and
fifth physical buttons on a device will thus send logical buttons 8 and 9.
The
.B ButtonMapping
option adjusts the logical button mapping, it does not affect how a physical
button is mapped to a logical button.
.PP
Traditionally, a device was set to left-handed button mode by applying a
button mapping of
.B "\*q3 2 1 ...\*q"
On systems using the
.B libinput
__xservername__ input driver it is recommended to use the
.B LeftHanded
option instead.
.PP
The
.B libinput
__xservername__ input driver does not use the button mapping after setup.
Use XSetPointerMapping(__libmansuffix__) to modify the button mapping at
runtime.
